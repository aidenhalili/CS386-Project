#3 Functional requirements

**1.)** The app accepts user input for time and sound

**2.)** When the alarm sounds, it will only shut off if a certain distance is traveled.

**3.)** 500 feet is the minimum distance for the alarm to shut off, but the user can input a higher target distance.

**4.)** Every foot travelled equates to a single point, which will go towards the user's all time score.

**5.)** When a certain amount of points are accumulated, new features will become available to the user(new alarm sounds, dark mode, etc.)

**6.)** The user can also press a button to track their walking distance without having to enable an alarm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Non-functional requirements

**1.)** Resource utilization - Utilizes user device's location services

**2.)** User interface aesthetics - Contains light colors which are easy on the eyes. The user can change the color scheme to suit their tastes

**3.)** User error protection - A number wheel will be used to minimize accidentally incorrect input.

**4.)** Accessibility - Contains three items in the bottom navigation bar to make it easy to navigate: Alarm, track distance only, score details, and settings.

**5.)** Availability - Will require user location services to use alarm and distance tracking feature.

**6.)** Recoverability - Regularly updates user score in server to minimize chance of losing progress.

**7.)** Confidentiality - Location services are only acquired via user consent.

#5 MVP

 *  For developing the minimal viable product for this project, we will first develop the app and add the features one at a time. Each member of the team can work on one of the features until it is complete and ready to implement. The features we will work on the six functional requirements. We will be validating our features by being able to implement the functional requirements into the app.

**2.)** 
Set alarm sound - this use case is for when a user wants 
to choose between different sounds available to them in the app. User will cycle through options and press the one that 
they want to use. 

Set alarm clock - The user sets the time for alarm to go off by typing in time into app. 

Set goal - User sets a distance goal in feet, yards, or miles for how far they want to move. Goal is different from
setting distance because a goal is something that they want to achieve over time.

Set distance - User sets the distance for how far to travel 
in order to turn the alarm off. 

Choose activity - User chooses between running, walking, biking,
etc. as an activity to turn the alarm off. 

Delete goal - User can delete the current goal and make a new one, or not have a goal at all.

Delete alarm clock - User can unset the alarm clock so that it no longer goes off at the designated time.
